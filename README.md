A example of resume coded in HTML5/CSS3 using Bootstrap 4 Framework
OpenClassrooms with "La Grande Ecole du Num√©rique"

This is the scenario

You've just started as a freelance web developer and a potential customer, who runs a dog grooming business, locates you on LinkedIn. However, your resume is not quite up to date. In order to answer his questions (and find new clients) you decide to create your own website to present your resume and thus be able to answer his questions. You choose to develop your site in HTML and CSS.

To avoid paying a server initially, you decide to host your site on GitHub Pages. So you immediately create an account to test this service. Satisfied with the simplicity of the process, you still do some research on the criteria of a good CV online, and finally choose this model: https://bibgate.github.io
